The paper includes a detailed description of the example in Section 2. 


## Running

You need to install sbt beforehand, get it at https://www.scala-sbt.org/ .  Last tested using sbt 1.1.6.
Sbt will then download the correct versions of scala, rescala,
and their dependencies, see build.sbt for required versions.

Run with:

~~~
$ sbt run           # execute the example code
~~~
